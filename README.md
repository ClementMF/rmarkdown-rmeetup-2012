## Talk title

Simple Reproducible Analysis with knitr, R Markdown, and RStudio

Reproducible analysis represents a process for transforming text, code, and data to produce reproducible artefacts including reports, journal articles, slideshows, theses, and books.  Reproducible analysis is important in both industry and academic settings for ensuring a high quality product.  R has always provided a powerful platform for reproducible analysis.  However, in the first half of 2012, several new tools have emerged that have substantially increased the ease with which reproducible analysis can be performed. In particular, knitr, R Markdown, and RStudio combine to create a user-friendly and powerful set of open source tools for reproducible analysis.

This talk will provide an introduction to Markdown and using knitr and R Markdown to produce reproducible reports.  In partiuclar, it will discuss caching slow analyses, producing attractive plots and tables, and using RStudio as an IDE.  The talk will also show how the markdown package on CRAN can be used to work with other R development environments and workflows for report production.  If time permits, the talk may touch on how knitr can be used with other markup languages including LaTeX and HTML.

# Suggestions
* interested in a practical talk on using Sweave with R, both to be able to
  produce quality tables, and reports that can be updated with new data (ie,
  like monthly reports)
* Also, if you could touch on latex, as R users who don't have an academic
  background won't be familiar with this.
* From a practical perspective, knowing any issues to install either sweave or
  latex would be useful.
